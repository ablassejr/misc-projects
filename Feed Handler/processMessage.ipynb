    "# Market Data Feed Handler - OrderBook Processing Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "You're building a component responsible for processing incoming market data messages and maintaining an up-to-date orderbook. The event stream begins with an initial snapshot of the market, followed by incremental updates represented by data blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "### DataBlock\n",
    "Each DataBlock contains an event type and relevant fields depending on that event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The four supported event types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ADD** – Insert a new price level with the specified quantity\n",
    "2. **CHANGE** – Modify the quantity at an existing price level  \n",
    "3. **DELETE** – Remove an existing price level from the book\n",
    "4. **DISCONNECT** – Clear the current OrderBook and mark the connection as inactive\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disconnect Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Any data blocks received while disconnected should not change the book. Instead, if a new snapshot is sent while disconnected, you must rebuild the book using that snapshot and apply any events whose DataBlock have a `seqNo` later than the snapshot's `asOfSeqNo`. It will be guaranteed that the `asOfSeqNo` is greater than or equal to the last DISCONNECT `seqNo`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### DataBlock Processing\n",
    "- DataBlocks must be processed sequentially (by `seqNo`) but are not guaranteed to be sent in order. This includes when the event stream is disconnected\n",
    "- The first block to be processed will always have a sequence number of 1, and the next one should have one of 2\n",
    "- ADD, CHANGE, and DELETE will affect bids if `isBuy` is True\n",
    "- ADD, CHANGE, and DELETE will affect asks if `isBuy` is False\n",
    "- CHANGE events can have a negative quantity\n",
    "- DELETE events will have a value of `None` for their quantity\n",
    "- DISCONNECT events will have a value of `None` for their price, quantity and isBuy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Snapshot Processing\n",
    "- Snapshots are always sent in order\n",
    "- Snapshots can only be sent at the start or after a DISCONNECT\n",
    "- A Snapshot is always sent at the start with an `asOfSeqNo` of 1\n",
    "- You may want to add methods to them and you are free to do so\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Your implementation will be tested against the following test cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Test | Description |\n",
    "|------|-------------|\n",
    "| `testAddEvent` | Single ADD DataBlock |\n",
    "| `testChangeEvent` | Single CHANGE DataBlock |\n",
    "| `testDeleteEvent` | Single DELETE DataBlock |\n",
    "| `testAllEvents` | All possible DataBlock events besides DISCONNECT |\n",
    "| `testDisconnect` | Multiple DataBlocks, a DISCONNECT event, multiple lost DataBlocks, and then a Snapshot |\n",
    "| `testOutOfOrderEvents` | Multiple DataBlock events besides DISCONNECT received out of order |\n",
    "| `testOutOfOrderLostMessages` | Multiple DataBlocks after a DISCONNECT received out of order |\n",
    "| `testMultipleDisconnects` | Multiple DISCONNECT DataBlocks received out of order |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can assume any DataBlock event is valid. For example, if we try to process a DELETE DataBlock the specified price will exist\n",
    "- You should not add or modify any of the fields in DataBlock, OrderBook, and Snapshot. If you want to add methods to them and you are free to do so\n",
    "- Upon a DISCONNECT event, only clear the existing OrderBook. DataBlocks received whose `seqNo` occur after the DISCONNECT should still be processed in sequence\n",
    "- You should aim to outperform brute force search on an iterable whenever possible\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the `processMessage` method in the `EventStream` class to correctly handle all DataBlocks and Snapshots according to the requirements above."

    "All test cases have been created to thoroughly test the OrderBook Feed Handler implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **testAddEvent**: Tests single ADD DataBlock operations for both buy and sell sides\n",
    "2. **testChangeEvent**: Tests CHANGE DataBlock including negative quantities (requirement)\n",
    "3. **testDeleteEvent**: Tests DELETE DataBlock with None quantity (requirement)\n",
    "4. **testAllEvents**: Tests all event types (ADD, CHANGE, DELETE) in sequence\n",
    "5. **testDisconnect**: Tests DISCONNECT clearing book, lost messages during disconnect, and snapshot recovery\n",
    "6. **testOutOfOrderEvents**: Tests sequential processing by seqNo regardless of arrival order\n",
    "7. **testOutOfOrderLostMessages**: Tests buffering and applying out-of-order messages after DISCONNECT\n",

    "### Key Requirements Tested:\n",
    "- ✅ DataBlocks processed sequentially by seqNo (not arrival order)\n",
    "- ✅ First block has seqNo=1, incrementing by 1\n",
    "- ✅ ADD/CHANGE/DELETE affect bids when isBuy=True, asks when isBuy=False\n",
    "- ✅ CHANGE events can have negative quantities\n",
    "- ✅ DELETE events have None quantity\n",
    "- ✅ DISCONNECT has None for price, quantity, and isBuy\n",
    "- ✅ DISCONNECT clears OrderBook and marks connection inactive\n",
    "- ✅ Messages during disconnect are not processed\n",
    "- ✅ Snapshot recovery rebuilds book and applies events with seqNo > asOfSeqNo\n",
    "- ✅ Out-of-order event handling and buffering"
