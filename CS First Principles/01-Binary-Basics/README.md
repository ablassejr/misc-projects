# Project 01: Binary Basics

## Overview

This project teaches you how computers represent ALL data as binary (0s and 1s) from first principles. You'll understand not just HOW to convert between formats, but WHY computers work this way at the hardware level.

## What You'll Learn

- **The fundamental reason** computers use binary (hint: it's about transistors!)
- How to convert between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal
- How negative numbers work (two's complement)
- How decimals work (IEEE 754 floating-point)
- How text is encoded (ASCII and UTF-8)
- The trade-offs between precision, range, and storage

## Files

- **GUIDE.md** - Interactive educational guide with questions and explanations
- **binary_converter.py** - Implementation challenges

## How to Use

### Option 1: Self-Guided Learning
1. Open `GUIDE.md` and read through each section
2. Answer the questions before revealing the answers
3. Implement the functions in `binary_converter.py`
4. Test your understanding with the synthesis challenge

### Option 2: Claude Code CLI Guided Mode
Ask Claude Code to walk you through the guide interactively:

```bash
claude-code "Guide me through the Binary Basics project in CS First Principles/01-Binary-Basics/GUIDE.md. Ask me each question, wait for my answer, then reveal the solution and move to the next question."
```

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Curiosity about how computers work
- Willingness to think through problems before seeing answers

## Time Estimate

- Fast path (coding only): 2-3 hours
- Deep understanding path (all questions): 4-6 hours
- Mastery path (extra challenges): 8-10 hours

## Success Criteria

You've mastered this project when you can:
- Explain WHY computers use binary at the hardware level
- Convert between number systems without tools
- Predict the range of values for n-bit representations
- Explain why 0.1 + 0.2 ≠ 0.3 in most languages
- Understand that all data is ultimately numbers with interpretation

## Next Project

Once you understand binary representation, you're ready for **Project 02: Hash Tables from Scratch**, where you'll learn how to organize and access data efficiently.
